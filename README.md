# Boston PBPK/PD Workshop September 2019
## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® (OSP Suite) workshop on PBPK/PD of Small Molecules and Antibodies

esqLABS is running an advanced one-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **PPBPK/PD of Small Molecules and Antibodies** on **Thursday 19th of September** at the **Workbar (Big Bang Room), 45 Prospect St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA** follwing the Boston QSP Meeting. The workshop covers concepts and application of combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:

- [x] Build small molecule and antibody/protein PBPK models in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Learn how to model drug-drug interactions in PK-Sim (DDI)
- [x] Extend the physiology of your PBPK model in MoBi
- [x] Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi
- [x] Conduct parameter identifications in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held by consultants & scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

## REGISTRATION

To register for the workshop, please (... to be updated)

The workshop is currently restricted to 40 participants.

Registration includes coffee- and lunch breaks.

## AGENDA

As use-cases for above learnings, we will 
 - model and simulate drug-drug interactions with midazolam and itraconazoile
 - build a PBPK/PD model for use of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in tumor treatment
